Install:
-drag the bronx_s1x.gsc into s1x_full_game/s1x/scripts
*basically the same as the old version but you dont need a folder inside scripts just the raw file

Features:
-snipers kill with one bullet
-teams are auto assigned on player connect
-save bot spawn (host only): crouch + dpad left (+actionslot 3 for kbam)
-drop canswap: crouch + dpad up (+actionslot 1 for kbam)
-give killstreaks: prone + dpad up (+actionslot 1 for kbam)
-refill ammo: crouch + knife 
-cycle prestige: prone + dpad down (+actionslot 2 for kbam)

Issues:
-s1x requires you to add a bot in the game settings menu, dont use "spawnbot 1"
-game doesnt read rounds properly so it doesnt give dna bomb on last round
-mid game change class is broken for some reason (it used to work)
-prestige doesnt save between rounds (persistence issue idk)
-refill ammo doesnt work for equipment (again gsc is not very cooperative on here)

*always check the github page for the most updated version
