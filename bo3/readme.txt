Install:
-only the host has to do this
-watch this tutorial showing how to set up the injector
-open bo3 and when you are in the pregame lobby run DebugCompiler.exe
-press I to select "inject compiled script"
-drag bo3_bronx.gscc onto the command window
-close the command window when you want to unload script

Features:
-save bot spawn (host only): crouch + dpad left (+actionslot 3 for kbam)
-give killstreaks: prone + dpad up (+actionslot 1 for kbam)
-refill ammo: crouch + knife 

Issues:
-have to set miniscule health in game settings
-authorization is team based, always pick black ops and always add bot to cdp
(change team assignment to open in global settings, so everyone can be on the right team)
-hud is weird on pc (i tried to fix but it isnt perfect)
