Install:
-watch this tutorial showing how to set up the injector
-go to the the project folder "bo3 bronx" and open the file "project"
-when in the pregame lobby run the inject keybind you have set

Features:
-save bot spawn (host only): crouch + dpad left (+actionslot 3 for kbam)
-give killstreaks: prone + dpad up (+actionslot 1 for kbam)
-refill ammo: crouch + knife 

Issues:
-have to set miniscule health in game settings
-authorization is team based, always pick black ops and always add bot to cdp
(change team assignment to open in global settings, so everyone can be on the right team)
-hud is weird on pc (i tried to fix but it isnt perfect)
